# Cards

I was bored very recently, and I suddenly decided to make a small little command-line renderer for playing cards. To show this renderer actually works, I made a quick little implementation of the game War.

**If you would like to simply see the results of the game, you can set the value `STEP_BY_STEP` to `False` and the game will not wait for user input**
